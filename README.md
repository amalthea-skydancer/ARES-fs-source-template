# ARES static site template

This is a template repository for creating a FS source for Nanite Systems ARES 0.5.0+

If you only have a few personas, drop them in the personas folder, but be aware that too many files in one directory could cause issues for ARES.

To add more folders, open `.github/scripts/generateIndexes.sh` and add them to the bottom of the file like the personas folder that is included here.
